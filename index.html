                <h1 class="w-full text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold mb-6 text-center"><span>About Me</span></h1>
                <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl font-medium leading-relaxed text-center">
                    I started programming at <span>10 years old</span> in an elementary school computer class, and I've been hooked ever since. 
                    The idea that I could create entire experiences with just a keyboard sparked a lifelong love for <span>software development</span>. 
                    Growing up in a rural town in <span>south Georgia</span>, I used <span>YouTube tutorials</span> and a shaky internet connection 
                    to teach myself how to build <span>websites</span>, <span>games</span>, and basic <span>apps</span>.

                    <br><br>
                    In 8th grade, I moved to <span>Coffee County</span>, where I finally had access to formal <span>computer science education</span>. 
                    I took CS classes in <span>8th</span> and <span>9th grade</span> that taught me proper web development with <span>HTML</span>, 
                    <span>CSS</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>. Throughout the rest of high school, I shifted focus to <span>engineering classes</span>, 
                    drawn to the hands-on nature of building and experimenting. My incredible <span>engineering teacher</span> encouraged me to 
                    incorporate <span>computer science</span> into my projects using <span>microcontrollers</span> and <span>online portfolios</span>. 
                    It was in these classes that I developed what I consider my most valuable skill: <span>problem solving</span>.

                    <br><br>
                    I also joined both the <span>TSA</span> and <span>VEX Robotics</span> teams, competing in <span>video game design</span> 
                    contests and building robots to face off in national competitions. I reached the <span>state finals</span> three years in a row, 
                    and in my senior year, our team advanced to the <span>World Championship</span>, where I served as the lead programmer. I also served as a 
                    <span>Robotics Captain</span>, reporter, vice president, and <span>TSA President</span> during my time in the organization.
                
                    <br><br>
                    After graduating high school, I was accepted into the <span>Georgia Institute of Technology</span>, where I'm currently pursuing a degree in 
                    <span>Computer Science</span>. At Georgia Tech, I've had the opportunity to explore everything from <span>full-stack development</span> to <span>
                    human-computer interaction</span>, while collaborating on real-world projects with teams across campus. Outside the classroom, I became heavily 
                    involved in my fraternity, <span>Chi Psi</span>, where I've served as both <span>Lodge Manager</span> and <span>Tech Chair</span>. In these roles, 
                    I was responsible for managing daily operations of the fraternity's Lodge, implementing digital systems to streamline our workflows, and ensuring the 
                    space remained organized, functional, and tech-forward for all our members.

                    <br><br>
                    Being a part of <span>Chi Psi</span> has also given me the chance to give back to the community in meaningful ways. Through our partnership with 
                    <span>Trees Atlanta</span>, I've volunteered to help remove <span>invasive plant species</span> and restore local green spaces across the city. 
                    Each year, we also organize a large-scale fundraiser for the <span>Atlanta Community Food Bank</span>, an event that brings together students, 
                    alumni, and neighbors to raise <span>thousands of dollars</span> for families facing food insecurity. These experiences have deepened my appreciation 
                    for service and the impact small, consistent efforts can have on the people around us.
